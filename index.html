    <p class="letter-r">W</p>e are afraid of death. As soon as a person encounters death for the first time - usually in early childhood and accompanied by a serious existential crisis - he immediately begins to ask himself a variety of questions. What will happen after? Why do I have to die? Will I just disappear?</p>
    <p>We are accustomed to thinking that these questions are peculiar only to our species - the one who has experienced religion and culture, who paints brilliant canvases and uplifting music, who leaves its name in the centuries or disappears immediately after death. But this is not so: our anthropocentrism plays a bad joke on our own brain (not to mention those species whose existence we subject to serious pressure).</p>
    <p>Do animals understand what death is? Do they ask themselves the same questions as we do? Do they mourn their dead and remember them years later?</p>
    <p>The answer, apparently, is a clear yes.</p>

    <p>When we talk about what we think of as “human,” it’s easiest to start with those who are most like us: the great apes. Do chimpanzees and bonobos, our closest relatives on the phylogenetic tree, understand what death is like? Carl Safina thinks so:</p> 
   <div class="qu">
    <img src="images/qu.png" alt="">
    <blockquote class="qu"><b>They seem to know. Sometimes they cause death themselves; sometimes they witness fatal accidents and are clearly aware of what’s happening. If a chimpanzee falls to his death from a tall tree, the others gather around, look at the dead man with expressions that seem like fear, and hug each other.</b></blockquote>
    </div>
    <p>There is a widespread belief that human culture and religion as such originated precisely with the first funeral rituals, when a person, torn apart by bitter feelings, found a way out in creating for himself another, afterlife, eternal life. The first funeral rites were surprisingly simple - a hole in the ground and some objects belonging to the deceased or those whose purpose was to help him in the next world. The rites became more complex over time, and now monumental Egyptian tombs, amazing in their subtle tragedy towers of death of the followers of Zoroaster and burial mounds have appeared. But no matter how luxurious the funeral feast and how great the tomb, the essence is the same - an attempt to somehow arrange the afterlife "dwelling" of a loved one. </p> 
    <p>Do animals bury their dead? For a long time it was believed that they did not. But now we know - elephants do it.</p>
