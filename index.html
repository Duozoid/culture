      For Whom the Elephant Trumpets?

    <p class="letter-r">W</p>e are afraid of death. When a person first encounters death – usually in early childhood and experiences a serious existential crisis – they immediately begin asking themselves a lot of questions. What happens next? Why do I have to die? Will I just disappear? I faced this questions much later than I should have. I was 18 years old and was hit by a truck at an intersection on a university campus.</p>
    <p>When you're young and you encounter death for the first time - even in a demo version - it's scary and leaves you with a lifelong fear. After that, even though I survived, recovered, and lead a relatively healthy life, albeit with some limitations, I'm constantly afraid of death.</p>
    <p>Maybe that's why when I came across articles about elephants burying and mourned their dead, I thought: My God, do they do that too? Is their trumpeting an expression of emotion, grief, sorrow? For whom are they trumpeting?</p>
    <p>We are accustomed to thinking that these questions are peculiar only to our species - the one who has experienced religion and culture, who paints brilliant canvases and uplifting music, who leaves its name in the centuries or disappears immediately after death. But this is not so: our anthropocentrism plays a bad joke on our own brain (not to mention those species whose existence we subject to serious pressure).</p>
    <p>Do animals understand what death is? Do they ask themselves the same questions as we do? Do they mourn their dead and remember them years later?</p>
    <p>The answer, apparently, is yes.</p>
    <p>In 2014, Koko, a female gorilla famous for learning to speak sign language, overheard a phone conversation about the death of her friend Robbie Williams - they had met many years before and Koko was absolutely delighted with her friend. Upon learning of Williams' fate, Koko showed only two signs - "woman" and "crying", and then <a href='https://www.today.com/pets/robin-williams-mourned-koko-gorilla-1d80056867' >closed herself off from the world</a>, experiencing grief.</p> 
    <div class="koko"> 
    <img src="images/koko.avif" alt="">
    <p>According to her caregivers, Coco was grieving, gloomy, her head was down, and her lips were trembling. She was suffering from the death of a loved one.</p>
  </div>
  <p>So Koko understood the concept of death - almost as we do. And if so, doesn't that make us even closer to other species, those we've come to regard as "lesser brothers" at best, and mere tools at worst?</p>

    <p>When we talk about what we think of as “human,” it’s easiest to start with those who are most like us: the great apes. Do chimpanzees and bonobos, our closest relatives on the phylogenetic tree, understand what death is like? Carl Safina thinks so:</p> 
   <div class="qu">
    <img src="images/qu.png" alt="">
    <blockquote class="qu"><b>They seem to know. Sometimes they cause death themselves; sometimes they witness fatal accidents and are clearly aware of what’s happening. If a chimpanzee falls to his death from a tall tree, the others gather around, look at the dead man with expressions that seem like fear, and hug each other.</b></blockquote>
    </div>
    <p>There is a widespread belief that human culture and religion as such originated precisely with the first funeral rituals, when a person, torn apart by bitter feelings, found a way out in creating for himself another, afterlife, eternal life. The first funeral rites were surprisingly simple - a hole in the ground and some objects belonging to the deceased or those whose purpose was to help him in the next world. The rites became more complex over time, and now monumental Egyptian tombs, amazing in their subtle tragedy towers of death of the followers of Zoroaster and burial mounds have appeared. But no matter how luxurious the funeral feast and how great the tomb, the essence is the same - an attempt to somehow arrange the afterlife "dwelling" of a loved one. </p> 
    <p>Do animals bury their dead? For a long time it was believed that they did not. But now we know - elephants do it.</p>
    <p>There have been rumors for quite some time that elephants actually do cry for their dead and even do something similar to burials, when the body of the deceased is covered with leaves and branches - but until recently there was no real evidence.</p>
    <p>In a 2024 <a href="https://threatenedtaxa.org/index.php/JoTT/article/view/8826/9721">paper</a>, researchers from India described five burials of Indian elephant calves that were made on plantation grounds without any human intervention. In each case, the elephants carried the dead by their trunks and legs and buried them upside down in irrigation drains, then tried to avoid the burial site. All five burials were located at a distance of 150 to 700 meters from populated areas and several kilometers from the nearest protected forest - that is, far from people and predators. In all cases, on both sides of the "grave" there were many elephant tracks of different sizes and excrement - this means that there was a whole herd at the burial site, and not individual representatives. Plantation workers who observed the process from the side reported that the burials were done at night. Within 40 minutes after the burial, the herd left the body and, after that, tried to bypass the burial site, despite the fact that they had previously used the paths near the plantations constantly.</p>
    <p>Scientists have removed the buried bodies, and therefore it is difficult to study how elephants would behave afterwards. But in natural conditions, elephants, elephants visit the burial sites of other elephants.</p>

      <p>Too much text</p>
      <h2>Memory</h2>
      <p>We remember those who have passed away for many decades. Do others do the same? Apparently, yes, and in this they are not much different from us.</p>
    <p>Why do elephants visit other elephants' graves? Well, for one thing, they may be visiting by chance - elephants usually have fairly conservative paths. Secondly, they may simply be curious. Thirdly - and this is probably the most likely theory - they are remembering.</p>
    <p>To test this hypothesis, a team of scientists conducted an experiment in Amboseli National Park in Kenya. Elephants living in the wild were shown three objects to see which attracted them. First, they were shown an elephant skull, a piece of ivory, and a piece of wood. The elephants showed much more interest in the ivory than the other two objects, and more interest in the skull than the piece of wood. The second time, the elephants were shown an elephant skull, a buffalo skull, and a rhinoceros skull. The elephants again showed great interest in the skull belonging to their own relative, and paid little attention to the other skulls. Finally, they were shown three elephant skulls, two of which belonged to matriarchs from other families, and the third to a recently deceased matriarch from their own family. This time, there was no difference - the elephants were equally attracted to all three skulls (This experiment was described in the book "<a href="https://www.amazon.com/zarig%C3%BCeya-Schr%C3%B6dinger-entienden-animales-Liber%C3%81nima/dp/8417121382">LA ZARIGÜEYA DE SCHRÖDINGER</a>" by Susana Monsó).</p>
    <p>Among animals, interest in the remains of relatives has been noted not only among elephants, but also among chimpanzees. There is <a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.210349">evidence</a> that they pay more attention to the skulls of their fellows. And in the Chimfunshi Reserve, for example, scientists <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep44091">recorded</a> what they called a "funeral rite": a female chimpanzee was cleaning the teeth of her deceased adopted son.</p>

    <h2>So for whom?</h2>
    <p>We don't know if they really mourn - we rather want to believe it. Perhaps all this is connected with the fact that, moving away from nature and other species, we become more and more lonely with each century. The more familiar and emotional for us is each new cultural feature discovered.</p>
<p>The problem is that despite our interest and attempts to preserve species, here and there animals die out in whole populations. And just as genetic diversity is important for the preservation of a species as a whole, so cultural diversity is apparently no less important.</p>
<p>Perhaps we are simply afraid to finally admit: <b>we are not alone</b>.</p>
<p>We are not alone in our understanding and fear of death. We are not alone in the face of nature and destruction. We are not alone in what makes us: emotions, love, traditions and culture, grief and joy.</p>
<p>We are all part of one big wheel - from the little bacteria to the blue whale, elephants and humans, chimpanzees and macaws. Perhaps the real truth is that the elephant trumpets for the same reason we cry.</p>
<p>So maybe I shouldn't ask why exactly the elephants trumpet. Maybe deep down I know: they always trumpet for me.</p>
